# Registered Electric Vehicles in California (2010-2020)


#### -- Project Status: [Completed]


## Project Intro/Objective
The goal of this project was to examine how many electric vehicles have been registered in California, which vehicles saw a growth over the years, and make predictions on which vehicle will have more registers in the future.

## Project Description
Acquiring data from [AtlasEVHub](https://www.atlasevhub.com/materials/state-ev-registration-data/) allowed me to get a snapshot of all registered electric vehicles in California up to December 2020. I'm a big car enthusiast, love modifying my cars, and love seeing how my home state is going to lead the climate fight in terms of the primary transportation method. From the data I was able to uncover which vehicles were preferred most by residents and which vehicles didn't catch people's attention. A challenge I faced during this project was determining whether all electric vehicles should be included and a count of each month versus highest count of registered electric vehicles and year in order to produce clear visuals. I applied linear regression to predict which electric vehicle will see growth next in terms of registered vehicles.
